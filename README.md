# Voice Recorder

## Product Overview

The Voice Recorder was created using the ATmega328P microcontroller that samples a given sound at 8 kHz frequency and saves them in an SD card in an 8-bit format. The recordings are saved as .wav files, therefore they can be both played by the speakers in the device and by plugging the SD card into a computer or any other supported device. The Voice Recorder has an LCD display for the User Interface and five buttons (Up, Down, Select, Menu) which can be used to navigate through the user interface and initiate recording and playing. The recordings can be played in three different modes. They are,
 
1) Normal Voice - The recording is played back without any spectral changes
2) Alvin Voice - The recording is played at a slightly faster pace and a higher pitch
3) Batman Voice - The recording is played at a slightly slower pace and a lower pitch
